  name: "Syneseizure"
  description: "<p>Wouldn't it be cool if you could feel sight? That's what one team of sciencehackers sought to explore, creating a mask that simulated synesthesia, a condition where senses get mixed up (e.g. associating colors with numbers or seeing ripples in your vision resulting from loud sounds). The team wanted to simulate a synesthetic sensation by mashing up sight (via a webcam) with touch (via vibrating speakers). Syneseizure is a fairly creepy looking hack: having only 24 hours to prototype it, the only mask sewing pattern the team could find was one for a gimp mask. Just going with it, they attached 12 vibrating speakers inside of the mask and wired them up to an arduino and then a webcam. The result is an all-encompassing head mask that vibrates on different areas of your face corresponding with different visual information picked up by the webcam, thus creating a sense of feeling if areas of a room are lighter or darker as you navigate around. </p>"

  name: "Arm Alarm"
  description: "<p>ArmAlarm will wake you up in a completely new way. Studies show that feeling awake is positively correlated with being physically active. Instead of annoying sounds, ArmAlarm is a wearable alarm that wakes you gently with vibrating pulses on your wrist. The alarm begins pulsing at your set time, and stops only when the built-in pulse reader determines that you are awake and active. With ArmAlarm, there is no snooze button. It won't turn off until your heart rate is up. The team combined an Arduino board with a salvaged cell phone haptic motor and IR transmitter and receiver bulbs as a pulse-detecting mechanism.</p>"

  name: "Isodrag Typeface"
  description: "<p>Typefaces often strive for visual consistency in their design, but what if they took their visual cues from the physical world? The Isodrag Typeface is a font designed by aerodynamics. The hack used a makeshift wind tunnel and recorded the aerodynamic drag of each uppercase sans-serif letter. The weight of each letter was altered until all letters were recorded as having equal drag. For example, the letter 'I' has low aerodynamic drag, so it was modified to be very thick. The product is a typeface that is aerodynamically consistent. </p>"

  name: "Galaxy Karaoke"
  description: "<p>What if you could turn an entire planetarium into a cosmic karaoke machine? That's what a team of science hackers at the Adler Planetarium did over the course of a weekend. Previously, a bunch of awesome Galaxy Zoo forum members collected a complete set of real galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, which just happen to look like letters of the alphabet. The Galaxy Karaoke team resurrected some previously hacked together code which takes these images and pastes them together into arbitrary words and sentences. The team then used this to generate lyrics to David Bowie's 'Space Oddity', put the images into a 3D model of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and choreographed a fly past the lyrics (spelled out using real galaxies!) in time with the song.

  name: "ISS Globe"
  description: "<p>Can you interact with space travel while you're relaxing at home or busy at work? Astronauts are continuously orbiting the Earth – sometimes you can see a fair glint of their spacecraft, the International Space Station (ISS), overhead on a clear night when they happen to fly past your location. What if you could always see where they were without going outside or opening your laptop? Inspired by previous Science Hack Day ideas like the Near Earth Asteroid Lamp, a lamp that would light up each time an asteroid passed by the Earth, the ISS Globe continuously shows you where the ISS is overhead. The team of sciencehackers used a translucent globe, two hobby servos, a MakerBot for 3D printing a few gears, a Teensy microcontroller and a laser that was mounted inside of the globe. Firmware controlled interaction between a laptop and the servos and a Python client controlled interaction between the microcontroller and the servos. The end product was a globe with a glowing red dot that would show you where the ISS currently was throughout the day. </p>"

  name: "Quake Canary"
  description: "<p>What if our phones could broadcast 'earthquake!' faster than we could tweet it? We are all cyborgs, after all; carrying devices that extend us physically and mentally. Those devices are more than just phones, though, they're also sensors – ubiquitous, cheap, widely distributed sensors that would in many ways be a scientist's wet dream to tap into. The Quake Canary hack put this concept to a specific test: could our smartphones detect earthquakes accurately? It seems so. By prototyping a proof-of-concept, the team demoed the ability for networked phones to detect earthquakes and instantly send data to the U.S. Geological Survey – potentially giving areas in danger early warning signals quicker. The hack has now blossomed into a project that's teaming up with machine learning and time-domain informatics experts from the University of California, Berkeley. New prototypes with improved algorithms have been created by the team in the last few months and they are preparing for expanded deployment of the project along the Hayward fault.</p>"

  name: "Id vs. Ego"
  description: "<p>Imagine playing a video game that changes the difficulty level based on monitoring your brainwaves. A couple of science hackers created such a game using the NeuroSky MindWave portable EEG brainwave headset. This device senses the player's brainwaves and provides an interface to access data from the device. They then used this information to control how the levels of the game itself are generated. The more calm and focused the player is, the easier the level becomes. This leads to some interesting moments when the player panics because the level is too difficult causing the level to become even more difficult. Next, they took the motion sensor output from an Apple iPad to control the character in the game. This made for a more intuitive experience when playing the game and makes the game more physical, which has some effect on the mental state of the player. The game itself is a rather simple one. The player must avoid rising platforms as they scroll toward the top of the screen. The speed at which the platforms rise is controlled by the player's level of calmness while the size of the 'holes' between the platforms is controlled by the player's level of focus. The player uses the iPad like a steering wheel to move the onscreen character back and forth. </p>"

  name: "DNAquiri"
  description: "<p>What does DNA taste like? Aside from the fact that DNA is very small, the materials needed to extract it often aren't edible, or if they are, they're not as delightful as a cocktail. Despite the copious amount of food present at Science Hack Day, a band of biohackers were hungry for more. They sought out to craft a recipe for extracting strawberry DNA that didn't require indigestible ingredients and could also double as a cocktail. Using strawberry puree and some very strong alcohol, the biohackers were able to extract the strawberry DNA into polymer clumps you could see with the naked eye. The final cocktail was definitely something that could knock you on your feet, but it has paved the way for more delightful science-based delicacies. </p>"

  name: "Particle Windchime"
  description: "<p>Instead of seeing visualizations of subatomic particle collisions, what if you could hear them? Matt Bellis, a Stanford particle physicist, teamed up with a focused group of hackers and experimented with mapping particle collision data with a variety of sounds. The result was an amusingly awkward symphony of science that you could control via a web interface. While on the surface it was a 'cute' hack, Bellis thinks that it could be considered as a sort of augmented diagnostic tool for accelerator laboratories to use for detecting problems in the accelerator. Subsequent hacks at Science Hack Days have also gone on to inspire particle physics in unexpected ways. One team created a beard-detecting hack using a USB microscope paired with a computer vision library that measured small lines – as a result of being exposed to this fun hack, Bellis has written a proposal for how to detect cosmic rays in a cloud chamber using similar techniques. </p>"
